# LiveCoding.NET
An API Wrapper for LiveCoding.tv written for and in .Net Framework

# What needs done
As of 30/07/2016 (7 Months later OUCH) 
I finally figured out oAuth in C#, had to use PHP to process the requests T-T
All that is required now is fallbacks for when the token becomes invalid etc and the Wrapping of the 
Requests which is mainly done before just need ported over to the new framework.

As of 18/01/16 the wrapper was just started,
the webclient requires OAuth and some of the schemas added

# Nothing more to say yet ;)
