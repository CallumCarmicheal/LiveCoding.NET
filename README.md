# LiveCoding.NET
An API Wrapper for LiveCoding.tv written for and in .Net Framework

# What needs done
The API is in a working condition although it would need to be rewritten to be simplier but as of right now it is works almost flawlessly... The programmer does have to jump through some hoops to set it up but once the token is set and you have access its almost freesailing from there.

What is required: Documentation.

# Nothing more to say yet ;)
